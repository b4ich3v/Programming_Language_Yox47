# **Yox47**

## **Description**

**Yox47** is a compact, statically‑typed, block‑structured programming language, written  in C++. It covers each stage of the toolchain — from tokenization and abstract syntax trees to semantic validation and optimized assembly emission. Yox47’s type system includes primitive types (`int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`), heap‑allocated `box[T]` arrays, and explicit function signatures. Control flow constructs comprise `if/else`, `for`, `while`, `break`, and `choose/case`.
